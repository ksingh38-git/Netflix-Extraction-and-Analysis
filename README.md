# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing Netflix data to extract meaningful insights and patterns. It covers data cleaning, handling of foreign characters, and performing various SQL operations for data analysis.

# Usage
## Data Cleaning
Run the netflix_data_cleaning_and_analysis.py script to clean the dataset and prepare it for analysis:


## python scripts/netflix_data_processing.py
Database Operations
Run the database_operations.py script to load data into the SQL database and perform necessary transformations:


## SQL Queries
Use the SQL scripts in the sql/ directory to create tables and perform data cleaning analysis directly in the database.

## Analysis Highlights
Handling Foreign Characters: Converted data types to support foreign characters and optimized the table structure.
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and ensured data integrity.
SQL Analysis: Various SQL queries were used to analyze the data, such as identifying directors with movies and TV shows, finding the country with the most comedy movies, and calculating the average movie duration per genre.

## Results
The analysis revealed several interesting patterns, such as:
Directors with a diverse portfolio of movies and TV shows.
Countries producing the most content in specific genres.
Average movie durations for different genres.
